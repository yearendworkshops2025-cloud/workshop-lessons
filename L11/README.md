# L11: Automation - Email Monitoring & Auto-Response

## What is this lesson about?

Learn about **automation** - making your computer do things automatically! Create a script that monitors your inbox and suggests AI-powered responses.

## The Challenge

Ask Claude Code to:
1. **Create an inbox monitoring script** that:
   - Checks for new emails periodically
   - Detects unexpected/new emails
   - Pops up an alert when new mail arrives
   - Shows an AI-generated response suggestion (using GPT-5 nano)
   - Lets you send the response with one click
2. **Explain what automation is**
3. **Explain what CRON is** - Scheduling tasks on computers
4. **Create an HTML presentation** about automation

## How to Start

```
cd ~/Lessons/L11 && claude+
```

Copy this and paste in terminal!

## What to Say to Claude
> "Create an email monitoring script that checks my inbox, alerts me when new emails arrive, and uses GPT-5 nano to suggest a response that I can send with one click. Explain what automation and cron jobs are. Create an HTML presentation about automation!"

## What You Will Learn

- What automation means
- How scripts can run automatically
- What cron jobs are
- How to integrate AI into automation

## Key Concepts

### Automation
Making computers do repetitive tasks for you automatically.

### CRON
A scheduler that runs tasks at specific times:
- Every minute
- Every hour
- Every day at midnight
- etc.

### Event-Triggered Automation
Code that runs when something happens:
- New email arrives
- File is created
- Button is clicked

## The Big Picture

> "Automation is just code running on a computer, triggered by events."

Whether it's:
- A cron job running every hour
- A webhook responding to a payment
- An email trigger sending notifications

It's all the same concept - code waiting for something to happen!
