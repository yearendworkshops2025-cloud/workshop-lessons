# L1: Hello World - Your First Code

## What is this lesson about?

Welcome to your very first coding lesson! In this session, you will:

1. **Create your first program** - A simple "Hello World" that displays text on screen
2. **Write it in 3 different languages** - Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript
3. **Understand the differences** - Why do we have different programming languages?

## What is "Hello World"?

Every programmer's first program is "Hello World" - a simple program that displays text. It's a tradition since the 1970s!

## The Challenge

Ask Claude Code to:
1. Create a simple Hello World program in **Python**
2. Create a simple Hello World program in **JavaScript**
3. Create a simple Hello World program in **TypeScript**
4. **Run each one** and show the output
5. Explain the differences between these three languages
6. **Create an HTML presentation** explaining all of this!

## What You Will Learn

- What a programming language is
- How to run simple code
- Why Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript exist
- What makes each language special

## How to Start

Open your terminal and type:
```
pwd
ls
cd Lessons
cd L1
claude
```

## Quick Start Command

```
cd ~/Lessons/L1 && claude
```

Copy this and paste in terminal!

## What to Say to Claude

> "Create a Hello World program in Python, then in JavaScript, then in TypeScript. Run each one and explain the differences between these languages. Create an HTML presentation explaining this!"

## Expected Output

Claude will:
- Create three files (hello.py, hello.js, hello.ts)
- Run each one and show the output
- Explain why each language is different
- Create a presentation you can view in your browser
