# L2.3: AI Coding Assistants Compared

## IMPORTANT: Complete L2, L2.1, and L2.2 First!

This is a sub-lesson of L2. Make sure you've completed the previous L2 lessons before starting this one.

---

## What is this lesson about?

Understand the **landscape of AI coding tools**! Learn what Claude Code is, how it compares to other AI coding CLIs, and when to use what.

## The Challenge

Ask Claude Code to:
1. **Explain what Claude Code is** - Its purpose and capabilities
2. **Explain what Codex CLI is** - OpenAI's coding assistant
3. **Explain what Gemini CLI is** - Google's coding assistant
4. **Compare all three** - Similarities and differences
5. **Show when to use each one**
6. **Create an HTML presentation** comparing all AI coding CLIs

## How to Start

Stay in the L2 folder (don't cd into L2.3!) and type:
```
claude+
```

## Quick Start Command

```
cd ~/Lessons/L2 && claude+
```

Copy this and paste in terminal!

## What to Say to Claude
> "Explain what Claude Code is and what it can do. Then explain what OpenAI Codex CLI and Google Gemini CLI are. Compare all three AI coding assistants - what are the similarities and differences? When should I use each one? Create an HTML presentation about AI coding assistants!"

## The Three Major AI Coding CLIs

### Claude Code (Anthropic)
- **What**: Command-line AI coding assistant by Anthropic
- **Model**: Claude (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **Strengths**:
  - Excellent at understanding context
  - Great at complex reasoning
  - Strong safety features
  - MCP plugin system
- **Command**: `claude` or `claude+`

### Codex CLI (OpenAI)
- **What**: Command-line AI coding assistant by OpenAI
- **Model**: GPT-5.1 Codex (optimized for code)
- **Strengths**:
  - Fast code generation
  - Great at common patterns
  - Strong at multiple languages
- **Note**: Different from GitHub Copilot (which is IDE-based)

### Gemini CLI (Google)
- **What**: Command-line AI coding assistant by Google
- **Model**: Gemini (Flash, Pro)
- **Strengths**:
  - Multimodal (can see images!)
  - Fast responses
  - Good integration with Google services
  - Image generation built-in

## Key Differences

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Gemini CLI |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Company | Anthropic | OpenAI | Google |
| Plugin System | MCP | Plugins | Extensions |
| Image Generation | Via API | Via DALL-E | Built-in |
| Context Window | Very Large | Large | Large |
| Best For | Complex tasks | Fast coding | Multimodal |

## What You Will Learn

- The AI coding assistant landscape
- How different companies approach AI coding
- Which tool is best for which task
- How to choose the right tool
