# L2.1: CLAUDE.md Management (Advanced)

## IMPORTANT: Complete L2 First!

This is a sub-lesson of L2. Make sure you've completed L2 before starting this one.

---

## What is this lesson about?

Now that you understand what CLAUDE.md is, let's dive deeper into how Claude Code manages its configuration files.

## The Challenge

Ask Claude Code to:
1. **Research CLAUDE.md management** - What types exist?
2. **Explain the difference between**:
   - User root CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
   - Project CLAUDE.md (in a project folder)
3. **Show how they work together** - Which takes priority?
4. **Create an HTML presentation** explaining the CLAUDE.md hierarchy

## What You Will Learn

- How Claude Code reads configuration from multiple files
- User-level vs project-level settings
- How to customize Claude's behavior for different projects
- Best practices for organizing your CLAUDE.md files

## How to Start

Stay in the L2 folder (don't cd into L2.1!) and type:
```
claude+
```

## Quick Start Command

```
cd ~/Lessons/L2 && claude+
```

Copy this and paste in terminal!

## What to Say to Claude
> "Research and explain CLAUDE.md management in Claude Code. What's the difference between the user's root CLAUDE.md and a project's CLAUDE.md? Show me examples and create an HTML presentation about this!"

## Key Concepts

- **User CLAUDE.md**: Global settings that apply everywhere (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- **Project CLAUDE.md**: Settings specific to one project
- **Inheritance**: How settings cascade and override each other

## Official Documentation

- **Memory & CLAUDE.md**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory
- **Settings**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings
