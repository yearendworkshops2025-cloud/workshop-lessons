Time to create something fun! In this lesson, you'll build a **multiple-choice text adventure game** where players click buttons to make choices and see what happens next.

## The Challenge

Ask Claude Code to:
1. **Create a text adventure game** with a fun story
2. **Use buttons** for player choices (not typing!)
